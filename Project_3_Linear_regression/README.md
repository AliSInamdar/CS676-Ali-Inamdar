# 📈 Linear Regression Streamlit App
# 🏠 Housing Price Predictor

This project is a user-friendly Streamlit app designed to perform Linear Regression on any uploaded CSV dataset. Users can select target and feature columns from the file and view model performance metrics like MSE, MAE, and R².

## 🚀 Features

- Upload your own dataset
- Select target and feature columns dynamically
- Trains a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluates the model with:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared Score (R²)
