## This is the ReadMe File for Project 1 - Deliverable 3.

- Here, we have created a project which makes API calls on the basis of the user inputs and gets us relevant search links for the same.

- I have used SERP API to make the API calls.
- Beautiful soup fro web scrapping those links and get relevant insights and information about a particular link.
- then by using various Hugging Face models to validate and authenticate the content of the weblink.

- Then , by using code , I have combined the various CSVs uploaded by my calssmates and created a larger datset.

-Then , I created a tokenizer to standardize the data and also used one-hot encoding to convert the categorical data.

- Then , I created a Neural Networks model with 6 dense layers to compute , train and validate my dataset.

- Afterthat , I made a Hugging Face API call to create and repo and upload my modeland all its artifacts there.

- Then , I also downloaded the model fromm there onto my local work environment.

- Then , I created a local inference of the model to make it work without the above mentioned code on my local work environment.
