# Project 1: URL-Credibility-Score

# URL-Credibility-Score 

A machine learning-driven project to assess the credibility of URLs using natural language processing and real-time data from search engines. This tool is designed to help determine the trustworthiness of websites by combining search engine results and content classification models.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rise of misinformation online, evaluating the credibility of websites has become crucial. This project aims to:

- Query search engines using **SERP API** to gather real-time context about a URL.
- Use **Hugging Face NLP models** to analyze website content and search snippets.
- Compute a **credibility score** that reflects how trustworthy a URL is, based on various heuristics and machine learning techniques.

## 🔧 Features

- 🌐 Real-time search result gathering via SERP API
- 🧠 Transformer-based NLP classification using Hugging Face
- 🧮 Credibility scoring algorithm based on content and context
- 📊 Output insights in an interpretable format

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Python` | Core programming language |
| `SERP API` | Search engine results for contextual URL data |
| `Hugging Face Transformers` | Pretrained NLP models for classification |
| `Requests` | API calls |
| `Neural Networks` | AI Predictions |
| `TensorFlow` | ML & AI Library |

## 🧠 Workflow

1. **Input a URL**
2. **Search SERP**: Fetch top search results for the domain using SERP API.
3. **Extract and Analyze**: Get snippets, titles, and metadata.
4. **Hugging Face Classification**: Use transformers to classify the content (e.g., trustworthy, misleading, clickbait).
5. **Score Calculation**: Combine search data and content classification to generate a final credibility score.
6. **Output Result**: Display score with explanation.
